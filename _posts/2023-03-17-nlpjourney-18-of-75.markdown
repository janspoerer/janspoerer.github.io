Long time no see! I am back with the updates and used the last weeks to hand in the first paper of my dissertation (I did not write it alone).

We did not yet publish the draft, but I will keep you posted and put a link one of the next posts if the article draft gets uploaded to a preprint archive.

## What Happened Since Last Week?

We handed in the first draft of an article that will likely be part of my dissertation.

We are already working on follow-up papers that build on the new paper.

Also, the B.Sc. student from our chair makes excellent progress and seems happy with our supervision.

And last, we had to switch the second supervisor for my dissertation due to a professional change on my initial second supervisor's end. And it turns out that he is very interested in my topic and I think we can collaborate on joint articles.

**The plan is still as follows:**
<ol>
  <li>Hand in paper no. 1 in January 2023.</li>
  <li>Hand in paper no. 2 by the end of June 2023 (Q2).</li>
  <li>Hand in paper no. 3 by the end of Q3.</li>
  <li>Hand in paper no. 4 by the end of Q4/by year-end.</li>
</ol>

## What Were the Biggest Obstacles?

As is always the case with these deadlines, it became a bit stressful towards the end. But I am happy with how everything went. We may or may not get into the conference of our choice, but the article should have a good chance of being accepted somewhere.

## Which Goals Did I Meet?

<ol>
  <li>Get equity research reports for the B.Sc. student.</li>
  <li>Make diagrams based on the preliminary experiments.</li>
  <li>Outline ideas to accommodate additional B.Sc. student topics.</li>
</ol>

## Which Goals Did I Miss?

<ol>
  <li>None! Well, I have to admit that I am cheating this time as these are five updates in one post.</li>
</ol>

## Was It a Good Week?

Yes. Other than the "first hand-in excitement," I am happy about having found a great replacement for my second supervisor (who unfortunately had to stop supervising my thesis due to a professional change on his end). It seems like there will be room for joint articles with my second supervisor as well.

## Short-Term Tasks for The Coming Week

<ol>
  <li>Get more equity research reports for the B.Sc. student.</li>
  <li>Continue to supervise B.Sc. student; be available for guidance and questions.</li>
  <li>Make an initial outline for the second paper.</li>
</ol>

## About "75-Step Journey Toward a Ph.D. in Natural Language Processing"

You will, from now on, witness my grind. Feel my blood, sweat, and tears.

With this series of articles, you become a real-life weekly witness of my dissertation progress, all in 75 steps. This has multiple purposes:

1) Forcing myself to keep moving through the power of public shame!

2) Helping other (prospective) Ph.D. students to stay motivated and to show that hard times are normal when going through this process.

3) Getting support from the community when I go through hard times.

## AI Tool Disclosure

With the release of ChatGPT, some authors started to disclose an AI declaration. Given that there is not yet common ground what constitutes ethical use of generative language models for writing, I think that transparency is the least authors can do: This post was aided by Grammarly and by LanguageTool. No ChatGPT or another generative language model was used as aid for writing this post.
