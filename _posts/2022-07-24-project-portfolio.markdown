## CV
My first freelance project started in August 2017, right after my undergrad in International Management from WHU. Back then, I helped a startup to raise money and professionalize their accounting and controlling. The full-time project lasted for about four months.

From early 2018, a year of working on a software startup followed. We developed a tool for improving Know Your Customer (KYC) processes for banks.

In the summer of 2018, I did a web development bootcamp at Le Wagon in Berlin to deepen my coding skills. Shortly after that, a year after undergrad, I enrolled in the first intake of the newly-created Applied Data Science program at Frankfurt School of Finance & Management.

In 2019, I got excited about crypto while attending a blockchain elective at Frankfurt School, held by Prof. Dr. Philipp Sandner and Christoph Kreiterling. I started to freelance for multiple companies and implemented backtesting solutions for them, and these were my first highly technical freelancing projects.

In 2020, I graduated from Frankfurt School and started to work at Commerzbank AG as a software engineer. Today, I am working as a software engineer in Commerzbank's DLT/Blockchain Lab.

In the same year, I enrolled in a Ph.D. program in computer science at the University of St. Gallen. Find more about it [here](/phdstudies).

Furthermore, I co-founded 21e6 Capital AG, a startup that provides investment advice to professional investors seeking to invest in crypto markets.
