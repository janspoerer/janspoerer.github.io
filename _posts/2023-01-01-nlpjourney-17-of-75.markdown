Yay, it's 2023. This week, I'm presenting my timeline for finishing all research articles in 2023 and how ChatGPT may play a role in that.

Also, Happy New Year!

## What Happened Since Last Week?

Well, instead, let's start with how last *year* went. I'm pretty satisfied with the year. Academics, job(s), and personal life went well and were in balance. While making steady progress in my professional life, I was also able to find time for regular exercise and family and friends. 

I hit my dream weight (which for me means gaining weight, not losing weight), finished the Ph.D. proposal and the Ph.D. course phase, and performed well professionally.

My only regret is that I often did not sleep enough.

**Now, how did last week go?** I read more about ChatGPT and thought about how this may impact my research.

My supervisor suggested that I could do information retrieval, which is my focus in the Ph.D., *using ChatGPT*.

So, ChatGPT may influence the research going forward.

**The plan is as follows:**
<ol>
  <li>Hand in paper no. 1 in January 2023.</li>
  <li>Hand in paper no. 2 by the end of June 2023 (Q2).</li>
  <li>Hand in paper no. 3 by the end of Q3.</li>
  <li>Hand in paper no. 4 by the end of Q4/by year-end.</li>
</ol>

## What Were the Biggest Obstacles?

A bit too much Christmas and too much eating. It could be worse.

## Which Goals Did I Meet?

<ol>
  <li>Found a new second supervisor. My initial second supervisor had a cancel his supervision for my thesis due to things out of my control.</li>
</ol>

## Which Goals Did I Miss?

<ol>
  <li>Get equity research reports for the B.Sc. student.</li>
  <li>Make diagrams based on the preliminary experiments.</li>
</ol>

## Was It a Good Week?

It was not so productive due to Christmas.

## Short-Term Tasks for The Coming Week

<ol>
  <li>Get equity research reports for the B.Sc. student.</li>
  <li>Make diagrams based on the preliminary experiments.</li>
</ol>

## About "75-Step Journey Toward a Ph.D. in Natural Language Processing"

You will, from now on, witness my grind. Feel my blood, sweat, and tears.

With this series of articles, you become a real-life weekly witness of my dissertation progress, all in 75 steps. This has multiple purposes:

1) Forcing myself to keep moving through the power of public shame!

2) Helping other (prospective) Ph.D. students to stay motivated and to show that hard times are normal when going through this process.

3) Getting support from the community when I go through hard times.
