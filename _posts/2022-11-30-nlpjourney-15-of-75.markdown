This week, not much happened. I got a bit frustrated with bugs in our code, and am still working on resolving these. Feels like working from a cave deep in a rock, without seeing any daylight.

I am also reaching out to potential data providers for the B.Sc. thesis of our student. She will need many equity research reports for her study. *So if you know anybody that works at a broker that has sell-side equity research reports, please connect me!*

<sup>We have Christmassy weather in Frankfurt!</sup>

## What Happened Since Last Week?

Working on bugs when training the models. I'll outline the main issues below.

## What Were the Biggest Obstacles?

Bugs, bugs, bugs. Not such a fun week.

Some code written locally does not work on the DGX AI computer.

## Which Goals Did I Meet?

<ol>
  <li>Expand the experiments to additional datasets/benchmarks.</li>
  <li>Align with the prospective B.Sc. student on research questions and the methodology.</li>
</ol>

## Which Goals Did I Miss?

<ol>
  <li>Make diagrams based on the preliminary experiments.</li>
</ol>

## Was It a Good Week?

My motivation is slightly downbeat today. No visible progress has been made as I am sitting in my coding cave without significant tangible results or signs of progress. One bug follows another.

## Short-Term Tasks for The Coming Week

<ol>
  <li>Fix the tokenizer bug in the code.</li>
  <li>Get equity research reports for the B.Sc. student.</li>
  <li>Make diagrams based on the preliminary experiments.</li>
</ol>

## About "75-Step Journey Toward a Ph.D. in Natural Language Processing"

You will, from now on, witness my grind. Feel my blood, sweat, and tears.

With this series of articles, you become a real-life weekly witness of my dissertation progress, all in 75 steps. This has multiple purposes:

1) Forcing myself to keep moving through the power of public shame!

2) Helping other (prospective) Ph.D. students to stay motivated and to show that hard times are normal when going through this process.

3) Getting support from the community when I go through hard times.
