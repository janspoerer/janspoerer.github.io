## About Me

Finance guy, turned software engineer.

Finance, data, software.

I write code, but also like to talk. So at my main job at Commerzbank, I do just that: being a software engineer and also doing internal communication for the blockchain/DLT team.

Also, I am a Ph.D. student in [Natural Language Processing (NLP)](https://ics.unisg.ch/chair-ds-nlp-handschuh/) at the University of St. Gallen (HSG). My focus is information extraction from documents from the financial domain.

And last, I an involed with [21e6 Capital AG](https://21e6.io/), an investment company for sophisticated, professional crypto investors.

## Technical Interests

I am a big fan of engineering challenges, less so of architectural challenges.

I code with Java, JavaScript/TypeScript, and Python. Starting with , the first language that I learned to really do well in was Ruby. 

I love writing with LaTeX.

I can recommend using a second brain/Zettelkasten software to just about anybody. I'm using the free option [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).
