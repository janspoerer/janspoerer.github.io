# Ph.D. Studies

I am working on a dissertation in the field of natural language processing (NLP). I am enrolled in a computer science Ph.D. program at the University of St. Gallen.

The tool I am developing as part of this dissertation will be a retrieval-augmented generator for financial documents. This means that one can provide a question and a PDF (with an annual report, for example) and get the answer to the question based on the PDF.

Modules in the `finrag-sequence` project:
```
|-pdf
|-embeddings
|-document_retriever
|-generator
```
