![Jan Spörer]({{ page.image }}){: style="float: right; padding-top: 10px; padding: 40px; max-width: 200px"}

Finance guy turned software engineer.

My three "professional passions" are: 1) finance, 2) data, and 3) software.

I write code, I but also like to talk. So at my main job at **Commerzbank**, I do just that: being a software engineer and doing internal communication for the blockchain/DLT team.

Besides that, I am a **Ph.D. student** in [natural language processing (NLP)](https://ics.unisg.ch/chair-ds-nlp-handschuh/) at the University of St. Gallen (HSG). My focus is question answering for financial texts.

And last, I am involed with **[21e6 Capital AG](https://21e6.io/)**, an investment company for sophisticated, professional crypto investors.

## Project Portfolio

Please find my project portfolio in this [post](post/2022/07/24/project-portfolio.html).

## Technical Interests

I am a big fan of **engineering** challenges.

I code with `Java`, `JavaScript`/`TypeScript`, and `Python`. After struggling with `Visual Basic`, `Fortran`, and `Turbo Pascal` in middle school, the first language that I learned to do well in was `Ruby`. This was then followed by getting deep into `Python`.

Sometime in the future, I would like to get into `Rust` and `Go`. I tried `Julia` and `R`, but have not liked either of those languages.

For software projects, `Java` and `JavaScript` are currently my main languages. My natural language processing (NLP) research happens exclusively in `Python` (supported by `Huggingface` libraries).

I recommend using a "second brain/Zettelkasten" software to just about anybody, and wrote a [post about it](/secondbrain).
