## About Me

Finance guy turned software engineer.

All about finance, data, and, software.

I write code, but also like to talk. So at my main job at **Commerzbank**, I do just that: being a software engineer and also doing internal communication for the blockchain/DLT team.

Also, I am a **Ph.D. student** in [natural language processing (NLP)](https://ics.unisg.ch/chair-ds-nlp-handschuh/) at the University of St. Gallen (HSG). My focus is information extraction for financial texts.

And last, I an involed with **[21e6 Capital AG](https://21e6.io/)**, an investment company for sophisticated, professional crypto investors.

## Technical Interests

I am a big fan of **engineering** challenges, less so of architectural challenges.

I code with `Java`, `JavaScript`/`TypeScript`, and `Python`. After struggling with `Visual Basic` and `Fortran` in middle school, the first language that I learned to really do well in was `Ruby`. This was then followed by getting deep into `Python`.

For software projects, `Java` and `JavaScript` are currently my main languages. My natural language processing (NLP) research happens exclusively in `Python` (supported by `Huggingface` libraries).

I love writing with `LaTeX`. All my academic texts are written with `LaTeX`.

I can recommend using a [second brain/Zettelkasten](/secondbrain) software to just about anybody. I'm using the free option [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).
