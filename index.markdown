# Welcome to My Blog!

![Jan Spörer]({{ page.image }}){: style="float: right; padding-top: 10px; padding: 40px; max-width: 200px"}

I am a **finance** guy who turned into a **software engineer**.

My three "professional passions" are: 1) finance, 2) data, and 3) software.

I am a **Ph.D. candidate** in [natural language processing (NLP)](https://ics.unisg.ch/chair-ds-nlp-handschuh/) at the University of St. Gallen (HSG). My focus areas are question answering for financial texts, the scaling behavior of language and vision transformer models, and AI benchmarks.

# Project Portfolio & CV

Please find my project portfolio in this [post about my projects & CV](post/2022/07/24/project-portfolio.html).

# Technical Interests

I am a big fan of **engineering** challenges.

I code with `Java`, `Kotlin`, `JavaScript`/`TypeScript`, and `Python`. After struggling with `Visual Basic`, `Fortran`, and `Turbo Pascal` in middle school, the first language that I learned to do well in was `Ruby` in 2017. Since 2018, I mainly use `Python`.

Sometime in the future, I would like to get into `Rust` and `Go`. I tried `Julia` and `R`, but I have yet to like either of those languages.

For software projects, `Java`, `Kotlin`, and `JavaScript` are currently my main languages. My natural language processing (NLP) research happens exclusively in `Python` (supported by `Huggingface` and `PyTorch` libraries).

I recommend using a "second brain/Zettelkasten" software to just about anybody and wrote a [post about it](/secondbrain).
