# Ph.D. Studies

## Overview

I am working on a dissertation in the field of natural language processing (NLP). The dissertation is part of a computer science Ph.D. program at the University of St. Gallen.

The tool, which is developed as part of the dissertation, will be a retrieval-augmented generator for financial documents. This means that one can provide a question and a PDF (with an annual report, for example) and get the answer to the question based on the PDF.

Modules in the `finrag-sequence` project:
```
|-pdf
|-embeddings
|-document_retriever
|-generator
```

This is the [chair's website](https://ics.unisg.ch/chair-ds-nlp-handschuh/).
